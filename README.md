## LFC API
Handling communications between two local instances of Lua interpreters. Uses the file IO library to initalize and monitor a communication file, then returns data when something is written to the file. Require the main.lua file and collect the returned table. The table contains three functions; comm.init(commfileName), comm.receive(commfileName, init), comm.send(commfileName, message). Check default-example for an example.
